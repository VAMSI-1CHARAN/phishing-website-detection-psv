# phishing-website-detection-psv
This project focuses on detecting phishing websites using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. It extracts key URL-based features and classifies websites as legitimate or phishing. The system is integrated with a Flask-based web application, allowing users to input a URL and get real-time predictions.
